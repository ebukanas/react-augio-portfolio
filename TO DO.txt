//changeNav should also run on load (now it only runs when you scroll)
//optimize images for loading
// window.addEventListener('scroll', changeNav); should also get trigerred when window height 
one possible semi solution for this:

another workaround would be to use intersectional observer instead of checking for window.Inner height.
The intersectional observe could just check when the two components intersect and then trigger the styling changes.
